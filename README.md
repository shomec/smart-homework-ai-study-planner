- **Premium UI**: Modern, glassmorphism-inspired interface built with React and Vanilla CSS.

## 🏗 Architecture

### AI Agents (CrewAI)
1. **🤖 Planner Agent**: Breaks down assignments into manageable study sessions.
2. **⏳ Time Management Agent**: Estimates durations and distributes workload across the week.
3. **🧘 Focus & Well-Being Agent**: Ensures breaks are included and workload is age-appropriate.
4. **🧠 Motivation Agent**: Adds encouraging notes and study tips.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Custom Premium CSS)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Orchestration**: CrewAI + LangChain
- **LLM**: Ollama (llama3.2)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shomec/smart-homework-ai-study-planner.git
   cd smart-homework-ai-study-planner
   ```

2. **Start the application with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   > **Note**: The first run will take a few minutes as it pulls the Postgres image, builds the services, and downloads the `llama 3.2` model (approx. 3GB) inside the Ollama container.

3. **Verify Services**:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - Ollama: [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434)

## 📖 Usage Guide

1. Open the **Frontend** at `http://localhost:5173`.
2. Enter your assignments in natural language.
   - *Example: "Math Midterm on Friday, History Essay due Tuesday, read Chapter 4 for Science."*
3. Set your **Daily Study Hours** (e.g., 2 hours/day).
4. Click **Generate Plan**.
5. Watch the **Agent Status** badges pulse as the AI team works on your plan.
6. View your **Weekly Schedule**, complete with breaks and motivational tips!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Ollama Model Not Found**: If the planner fails or hangs, the model might not have pulled correctly. Run this command manually while the containers are running:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec ollama ollama pull llama 3.2
  ```
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports `5173` (Frontend), `8000` (Backend), and `5432` (Postgres) are free.
